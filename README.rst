ðŸ“¡ Deep brain state classification of MEG data
========

This project aims to perform cross-subject multi-class classification based on MEG signals to infer the subject's state. The implemented models are AA-CascadeNet, AA-MultiviewNet and AA-EEGNet, all of which incorporates both self and global attention mechanisms. 


ðŸ“Š Results
-----

The results for cross-subject testing of models that are trained with only 12 subjects on 6 testing subjects are shown below.

ðŸ’» Installation
-----

The required modules can be installed  via

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  
ðŸ“‚ Data
-----

- Data for the Cascade and the Multiview networks at the following `link <https://mega.nz/file/KcsXELzR#HLpcYcP7g5VM4NdAIM4M-hxXjyhtLncbrj4xUh6Zr9k>`__

- Data for EEGNet network at the following `link <https://mega.nz/file/GVk0EKCI#GX6agShuNWVx2ucktIiJPRkwLQDQCI6BNeFP-tq5pwM>`__

Both datasets contain the same subjects for training, validation, and testing, but they slightly differ in the trials selected.

ðŸ“œ Scripts
-----
The data must be downloaded and unzipped in the same directory as the scripts. For each model:

- The training script trains and saves the model with the indicated subjects.

- The test script loads the model previously saved and evaluate it with the indicated subjects.

Additionally, within the EGGNet directory, a script to download and preprocess the subjects directly from the HCP source can be found (just in case the user wants to use different patients).
